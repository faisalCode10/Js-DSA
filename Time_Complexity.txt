Algorithm Complexity:
.Algorithm basic: 
	Steps to do ant thing is called algorithm.
	1)i.e data = []
	2)el= 10
	3)define loop
	4)match element in loop
	5)if el == match 
	6)search complete
	7)if not match 
	9)No search found
.What is algorithm complexity:
	There are more than one appaorach to a problem its upto us which kind of algo we are using to
	solve our problem 
	There are two type of complexity
	1) Time complexity
	2)Space complexity
.What is time Complexity:
	.The time complexity is mainly calculated by countig the number of steps to finish the execution

.What is space complexity:
	.Space complexity is the amount of space required to solve a problem
	.Space complexity = Auxiliary space + input size
.Big O notation:
	.Use to denote complexity(both)
